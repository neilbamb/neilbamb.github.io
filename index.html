          Hi, I am Neil, currently working in Citi as a Senior Analyst. I like to build and develop software and machine learning solutions. 
          
          I have worked as a Software Developer on some amazing projects in the banking domain and machine learning - particularly, Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
          I'm highly organized, analytical, enjoy solving problems, and working with other smart people. 
          If you were to speak with my former teammates and classmates, they’d likely characterize me as someone who enjoys working on teams and gets excited about synthesizing information. 
          When not at work, I mostly work on projects, certifications and learning about new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a diverse set of skills, ranging from Java, Python, SQL, PowerBI and AWS.
          I personally feel that data will play a huge part in how software are designed.
          Right now, the software solutions which are out there is more generalized to the mass. But data will allow us to create more specialized solutions which is specific to each client. Machine Learning and AI is the kind of technology which will power every industry in the coming decade.
          I am passionate about building things that make a difference in our society.
