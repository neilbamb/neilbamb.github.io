First of all, Thank you for stopping by.

# Who am I?
Hi, I am Neil, currently based in Dublin and pursuing my Masters in Data Analytics. I like to build and develop software and machine learning solutions. I have worked as a Software Developer on some amazing projects in the banking domain and machine learning - particularly, Natural Language Processing (NLP). I'm highly organized, analytical, enjoy solving problems, and working with other smart people. If you were to speak with my former teammates and classmates, theyâ€™d likely characterize me as someone who enjoys working on teams and gets excited about synthesizing information. When not at work, I mostly work on projects, certifications and learning about new technologies.

I have a diverse set of skills, ranging from Java, Python, SQL, Tableau and AWS. I personally feel that data is going to be the next currency and the company which has data is going to rule the world. Right now, the software solutions which are out there is more generalized to the mass. But data will allow us to create more specialized solutions which is specific to each client. Machine Learning and AI is the kind of technology which will power every industry in the coming decade. I am passionate about building things that make a difference in our society.

#### I believe in the statement -
> "LEARN, PRACTICE, IMPLEMENT, REPEAT"


# What is this site about?
Starting a blog and creating an online presence, to share my learnings which was always on my todo list. Finally, I decided to  it.
I want to use this site as a place to share my experiences with interesting programing problem solving, hoping someone will benefit from the findings.
